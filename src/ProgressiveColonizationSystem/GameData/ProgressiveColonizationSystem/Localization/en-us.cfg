        #LOC_PKS_RocketPartsFactory_Parts_Description = Hey, anybody can slap a rocket together on Kerban; making the things out there is just a touch harder.  But you know, pounding out a fuel tank is one thing, building a full-on guidance control thruster is another.  This factory builds Rocket Parts from a combination of locally-available resources and stuff hauled from Kerbin (Complex Parts).  As the Kerbals get experience building rocket parts in space they'll be able to build the rocket out of more locally generated parts.
        #LOC_PKS_Agroponics_Parts_Description = Turns stinkies into snacks!  Some say it does it through complex organic processes!  Some say it's just a whole lot of chili peppers!  Either way there's a limit to how much of this stuff you really want to eat.  As 'Agroponic' research advances to higher tiers, Kerbals can make better and better agroponic snacks.  With all agroponic parts, there's a "Capacity", which is how much it'll actually produce, and the "Quality", which varies by tier and is the maximum percent of a Kerbals' diet that this food can make up.  So, a low-tier part with a "Capacity" of 1 and a "Quality" of 20% would be able to suffice for a crew of 5 - but you'll have to truck up a lot of snacks from Kerbin to make up for the missing 80% of their diet.  Note that Agroponics can only be done in orbit and you can only research up to tier-2 with stations in Kerban orbit.  To get the good stuff, you gotta get out there.  Also, Agroponic food has to be eaten quickly - it's bad to begin with, you don't want to know what happens after you let it sit.
        #LOC_PKS_Agriculture_Parts_Description = Broccoli!  Kerbals love the stuff!  Well, maybe love is too strong a word.  But in any case, Broccolli's a whole lot better tasting than that agroponic slop that Bill keeps trying to call food.  Farming modules have a "Capacity", which is how much food it produces per day (1 unit of capacity could feed one kerbal for a whole day, if the kerbal would actually eat Broccolli exclusively).  It gets better as you tier-up - you know, raw broccolli, grilled broccolli, deep-fried broccolli, and finally beef & broccolli.  Each planetary body presents its own farming challenges, so you have to research it on each planet.  You can't even create a farming module for a world until you recover a probe that's actually landed there.  You can flash-freeze your produce and munch them on your trip home.
        #LOC_PKS_FertilizerFactory_Parts_Description = Makes fertilizer for your Agroponic and Agriculture modules.  Yep, a boring and dirty business best left to a trained Engineer.  This factory has a "Capacity", which is how many units of Agriculture or Agroponic modules it can support.  For each unit of Fertilizer it produces, it consumes one unit of "Stuff", whatever that is.  You need a part that is definitely not a drill to get Stuff.  The output of this part is tiered too - you need Tier2 fertilizer to feed a Tier2 farm (or a Tier0 or Tier1 farm).
        #LOC_PKS_ShiniesFactory_Parts_Description = Okay, so Kerbals have gone to space and discovered that other planets are just giant rocks; not even rock candy.  But hey, that's nothing that the KSP Sales and Marketing team can't fix!  Yeah, what you do is mine up some dirt, put a bit of polish on it, box it up, send it home and sell it as fabulous space-bling!  We'll make millions!  We'll finally be able to install that bowling alley in the Astronaut Complex!
        #LOC_PKS_StuffScrounger_Parts_Description = This is not a drill...  Well, okay, maybe it is a drill.  It gets stuff from the ground that can be turned into fertilizer and shinies.  At Tier0 and Tier1, this is all you need to grind up some fertilizer and not-so-shiny shinies.  At higher tier, you'll need a Portable Resource Scrounger mounted to a rover or some other craft that can zoom about the body collecting "CrushIns".  To find where to go to get it, check out the scanner hub that you put in orbit around the planet.
        #LOC_PKS_PortableDigger_Parts_Description = Just the thing to dig up those hard-to-find Tier2+ resources.  Note that the stuff this drill gets just augments what is provided by the main scrounger at the base; it doesn't completely replace it.
        #LOC_PKS_ScannerHub_Parts_Description = An orbital control hub and data collection site for coordinating resource scanning on a body.  It needs to be located on a station orbiting the body you're scanning for.  It gets more effective at spotting stuff (that is, it's more likely to find something close to your base) if you have more satelites in orbit equipped with resource scanners.  The station needs to have qualified kerbals to run the system as well.  This part is also tiered - so you need a Tier-3 scanning hub in order to spot Tier-3 goodies on the ground.
        #LOC_PKS_Manufacturer = Nermable Nermables, Pty. Ltd.
        #LOC_PKS_SnacksBox_Parts_Description = Think of it as a really big lunchbox.  Well, maybe not big, depending on your budget.  These tanks can be configured to either store the prime grade-A "Snacks" that are produced on Kerbin or whatever Bob manages to hoe out of his greenhouse.  You can also reconfigure these tanks in-flight - but be careful if you do that, as it'll jettison the tanks contents.
        #LOC_PKS_FertilizerBox_Parts_Description = Fertilizer!  Just the stuff to turn stinkies back into shacks.  Some say it's a powerful organic suppliment; some say it's just some really spicy peppers.  These tanks can be configured to either store the prime grade-A "Snacks" that are produced on Kerbin or whatever you manage to prize out of a far-off planet.  You can also reconfigure these tanks in-flight - but be careful if you do that, as it'll jettison the tanks contents.
        #LOC_PKS_ShiniesBox_Parts_Description = What better to haul back all that phat lewt the boys have been making out there in the wider solar system?  Just haul this box out there, fill it up with the product of your labor, bring it back home and rake in the dough baby.

        #LOC_KPBS_SHE = she

        #LOC_KPBS_SCANNER_FIND_NOSATS = [perp_name] was told this would be an easy job - just click a button and the orbiting satellites would tell [perp_himher] what the closest glop of stuff was.  But no.  Bill forgot to put up any scanner satellites so [perp_name] is gonna have to use manual override.  Peering through the scope, there seems to be a shiny spot on the horizon...
        #LOC_KPBS_SCANNER_FIND_SATS = Peering through the scope and randomly twisting the instrument's dials, [perp_name] has spotted a rich deposit of [resource_name].  How those yoohoos down below are going to get to it is strictly not [perp_hisher] problem.

        #LOC_KPBS_HYDROPONIC_BREAKTHRU_0 = After months of scheming, [victim_name] finally figured it out.  If they just act like they like this green mush, and then sell it - I mean really sell it - to the gang at Mission Control, there's a really solid chance they'll bring them home and let them have pizza again.
        #LOC_KPBS_HYDROPONIC_BREAKTHRU_1 = [perp_name] has cracked the code!  If [perp_heshe] just takes the green goo, and then molds it into the shape of a triange and sprinkles a lot of salt & MSG on it, then secretly places it in the real snack storage in bags that say 'DOITOS' on it, the crew will just pound down bag after bag of the stuff.
        #LOC_KPBS_HYDROPONIC_BREAKTHRU_2 = While contemplating the incredible vastness of space and staring at yet another of the flat green lumps that [perps] have been trying to pass off as 'chips' that [victim_name] surprised everyone with the simple answer:  They needed to turn some of the leftover goo into dip!  It's as simple as that!
        #LOC_KPBS_HYDROPONIC_BREAKTHRU_3 = It's still green, it's still gooey, and it still smells a bit like armpit, but [crew] have come to the grudging realization that [perp_name]'s latest creation is likely to be as good as this goop will ever be.
        #LOC_KPBS_HYDROPONIC_BREAKTHRU_4 = It was while trying [perp_name]'s latest creation, Greenish-Goo Surprise, that [victim_name] found that by duck-taping [victim_hisher] nose closed, the stuff was a whole lot easier to get down.  Thus paving the way to a new era in interplanetary cuisine!

        #LOC_KPBS_HYDROPONIC_BREAKTHRU_BORING = You can now set the tier of hydroponic parts to [tier] in the VAB.  You cannot retrofit or fix this part to be a higher tier than it is.  You can keep using it, but it won't be as effective as a new part and you can't do research with it.  The new part will be more effective - you can see just how much so in the VAB/SPH.  Agroponic research is limited by how close you are to Kerbin.  Your max tier is 2 near Kerbin; it can be researched up to 3 at orbits around one planet inside and outside of Kerbin's orbit and the final tier can only be unlocked beyond those planet's orbits.

        #LOC_KPBS_FARMING_BREAKTHRU_0 = It took a while, but [perp_name] figured out how to get [victims] to eat more of the crop - [perp_heshe] told the crew [perp_heshe] rerouted the greywater plumbing out of the farm module and into the drill coolant module instead, proving the point, it's not what you sell, but how you sell it that counts.
        #LOC_KPBS_FARMING_BREAKTHRU_1 = [victim_name] had been plotting against [perp_name]'s scheme of creating a hybrid of broccoli, okra, eggplant and prunes for weeks.  [perp_name] knew something was in the works; [perp_heshe] had seen how the rest of the crew had been looking at [perp_himher].  But no Kerbal could have anticipated the unexpectedly (and certainly unintentionally) synergistic effect that the fully weaponized robotic nematode had on the sickly mutated plants...  A vegetable that tastes like chicken!

        #LOC_KPBS_FARMING_BREAKTHRU_BORING = You can now set the tier of farming parts to [tier] in the VAB.  You cannot retrofit or fix this part to be a higher tier than it is.  You can keep using it, but it won't be as effective as a new part and you can't do research with it.  The new part will be more effective - you can see just how much so in the VAB/SPH.  Farming is a body-specific thing - this breakthrough only applies to the body you're landed at.  Farming also relies on fertilizer - basically you either have to generate an equal tier on the body you're at or bring it from home.

        #LOC_KPBS_PRODUCTION_BREAKTHRU_0 = [perp_name] was specially selected for this mission because it's a well known fact around the astronaut complex that [perp_name] really likes to look at dirt.  Great things were expected of [perp_himher] from the beginning...  Maybe a little sooner than they actually came, but the breakthrough finally happened.  Yes, [perp_name] has conclusively proven that some of the dirt around here is better for fertilizer, some is better for making shiny things, and some is really only good for wiggling your toes in.
        #LOC_KPBS_PRODUCTION_BREAKTHRU_1 =Truly shocking!  It's been found that by lubricating the gearing in the fertilizer plant with [perp_name]'s toe cheese, production goes up 25%!
        #LOC_KPBS_PRODUCTION_BREAKTHRU_BORING = You can now set the tier of fertilizer plants and stuff scroungers to [tier] in the VAB.  You cannot retrofit this part to be a higher tier than it is.  You can keep using it, but it won't be as effective as a new part and you can't do research with it.  The new part will be more effective - you can see just how much so in the VAB/SPH.  Production is a body-specific thing - this breakthrough only applies to the body you're landed at.

        #LOC_KPBS_SCANNING_BREAKTHRU_0 = At first it was thought to be caused by the cosmic background noise, and then harmonic distortion from sunspots on Kerbal.  But [perp_name] knew better.  After months of painstaking study and analysis it was determined that it was, in fact, a radio signal, beamed from a distant planet in the alpha quadrant at roughly 4-day intervals, an hour at a time, which, when carefully and meticulously decoded and interpreted by [perp_name] with help from the entire KSP staff was a documentary series entitled 'The A-Team'.
        #LOC_KPBS_SCANNING_BREAKTHRU_1 = Last night was a turning point.  [perp_name] finally saw the curious formation at sector Zed Zed 9 Plural Zed Alpha really was just a pile of rocks. Yes.  Certainly.  Just rocks.  Reluctantly, [perp_name] recalibrated the instruments to actually look for that Stuff the guys on the surface and yeah.  Sure enough. There's stuff down there.  Great.  <sigh>
        #LOC_KPBS_SCANNING_BREAKTHRU_BORING = You can now set the tier of scanners to [tier] in the VAB.  You cannot retrofit this part to be a higher tier than it is.  You can keep using it, but it won't be as effective as a new part and you can't do research with it.  The new part will be more effective - you can see just how much so in the VAB/SPH.  Scanning is a body-specific thing - this breakthrough only applies to the body you're landed at.

        #LOC_KPBS_SHINIES_BREAKTHRU_0 = Once again Duck-Tape is core to a breakthrough in space science! In one of [perp_name]'s more brilliant insights, it's been found that by duck-taping closed the doors to the KSP legal department, and then removing all those warning labels that say "Danger!  May contain alien microbes that could wipe out all life on the planet!" sales of [body]-Dirt facial scrub shot through the roof!
        #LOC_KPBS_SHINIES_BREAKTHRU_BORING = You can now set the tier of shinies to [tier] in the VAB.  You cannot retrofit this part to be a higher tier than it is.  You can keep using it, but it won't be as effective as a new part and you can't do research with it.  The new part will produce the next tier of shinies, which are more valuable than this tier.  Shinies that are made near Kerbin aren't so shiny - they're limited to Tier2 on Kerbin's moons, 3 at bodies in easy reach of Kerbin, and can only get to 4 at difficult bodies

        #LOC_KPBS_CONSTRUCTION_BREAKTHRU_0 = Rocket Science.  Turns out it's really not that hard.
        #LOC_KPBS_CONSTRUCTION_BREAKTHRU_BORING = You can now set the tier of Rocket Part Factories to [tier] in the VAB.  You cannot retrofit this part to be a higher tier than it is.  You can keep using it, but it won't be as effective as a new part and you can't do research with it.  The new part will be able to use a greater percentage of locally-produced parts to make a single rocket part.  Construction is a body-specific thing - this breakthrough only applies to the body you're landed at.

		#LOC_KPBS_IDEAL_TIER = This is probably the one you want to pick.
		#LOC_KPBS_SCANNING_SKILL_LAGS = In order to make things at landed bases, you need to be able to find stuff,\nand that means you need the planetary scanning skill to match.  If you think\nthat by the time this base is landed that you'll have a scanner of equal tier\nin orbit, then it's safe to build this part.  Otherwise, you should probably\nhold off on deploying this tier of gear.
		#LOC_KPBS_SUBORDINATE_SKILL_LAGS = This part requires input of the same tier as the output, and the required\nprogression for that input has not been met.  It is almost certainly a\nmistake to build a base with a part of this tier.
		#LOC_KPBS_UNDER_TIER = You have all the required tech tiers to deploy a more advanced version of this part;\nyou almost certainly should do so.
		#LOC_KPBS_NOT_RESEARCHED = You cannot choose this tier because you haven't deployed and used a\npart of lower tier yet.  Start small, build up.
		#LOC_KPBS_CHOOSE_A_BODY_FIRST = You need to choose which body before you can select a tier.
